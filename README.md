# quick-pad: a dead simple collaborative notepad

This code is absolute garbage and should be cleaned up but:
1: It kind of works anyways
2: Load perf is pretty dang good. (because it's dead simple)

## Quick Start

You can start the app locally (redis, postgres, and frontend) with Docker by running:

```bash
npm run up
```

Your local files will be bind-mounted and the app will be hot-reloaded.

## Contributing

Contributions are very very welcome. Please contribute.

1: Be a nice person when you're contributing.

2: Keep in mind small changes are generally easier to write and approve, but don't be afraid to make large scale changes for big features!

3: When contributing ideas for features, keep in mind that this is inherently a very simple app with a very simple interface. I'm not looking for lots of bells and whistles.

4: Heavily consider performance. Profile when you're unsure.
